### Hi there, I'm Max ðŸ‘‹


Currently doing my Masterâ€™s degree in Robotics at ETHZ where Iâ€™m focussing on robot navigation and planning for autonomous systems.
In the past, Iâ€™ve also worked on motion planning for autonomous vehicles at I6 @ TUM and did my Bachelorâ€™s thesis on [scenario generation for autonomous driving](https://github.com/rasaford/scenario-generation). Additionally, Iâ€™ve [tutored students at both TUM and HdM](https://github.com/rasaford/grnvs-repetitorium-2020). If youâ€™re interested to learn more, drop me message ðŸ˜‰.

### ðŸš€ Fun Stuff I do

- Real-time mapping and planning for [ANYmal](https://www.anybotics.com/)
- Visual (Innertial) Odometry on the [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/) dataset
- VR training for tele-operating for [Roboy](https://roboy.org), [Roboy/TeleportVR](https://github.com/Roboy/TeleportVR).
- Traffic scenario generation for Autonomous Vehicles, [rasaford/scenario-generation](https://github.com/rasaford/scenario-generation)
- Teaching computer networks, [rasaford/grnvs-repetitorium-2020](https://github.com/rasaford/grnvs-repetitorium-2020)
