### Hi there, I'm Max ðŸ‘‹


Currently doing my Masterâ€™s degree in Robotics at ETHZ where Iâ€™m focussing on robot navigation and planning for autonomous systems.
In the past, Iâ€™ve also worked on motion planning for autonomous vehicles at I6 @ TUM and did my Bachelorâ€™s thesis on [scenario generation for autonomous driving](https://github.com/rasaford/scenario-generation). Additionally, Iâ€™ve tutored students at both TUM and HdM. If youâ€™re interested to learn more, drop me message ðŸ˜‰.
